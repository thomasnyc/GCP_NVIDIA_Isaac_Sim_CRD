# NVIDIA Isaac Sim Development Workstation (Linux) with Chrome Remote Desktop:

Use Chrome Remote Desktop to access the NVIDIA Isaac Sim Development Workstation (Linux), providing secure access to the graphical user interface.

Discussion:

Chrome remote desktop is NOT designed for heavy graphical applications. We see about 60 - 120 fps with NVIDIA Isaac Sim Desktop usage which is sufficient for normal usage. FPS can vary with network connection and other variables.  If user experience is not acceptable, we suggest using HP anywhere.

## Install Chrome Remote Desktop on the VM instance



1. In the SSH window for your VM instance, add the Linux Chrome Remote Desktop repository to your apt package list, and install the chrome-remote-desktop package.

The system will reboot itself and ready for the next step: 


## Configure and start the Chrome Remote Desktop service

To start the remote desktop server, you need to have an authorization key for the Google Account that you want to use to connect to it:



1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **VM Instances** page: \
[Go to the VM Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances/)
2. Connect to your instance by clicking the **SSH** button.
3. On your local computer, using the Chrome browser, go to the Chrome Remote Desktop command line setup page: \
[https://remotedesktop.google.com/headless \
](https://remotedesktop.google.com/headless)
4. If you're not already signed in, sign in with a Google Account. This is the account that will be used for authorizing remote access.
5. On the **Set up another computer** page, click **Begin**.
6. Click **Authorize**. \
You need to allow Chrome Remote Desktop to access your account. If you approve, the page displays a command line for Debian Linux that looks like the following:

DISPLAY= /opt/google/chrome-remote-desktop/start-host \

    --code="4/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" \

    --redirect-url="https://remotedesktop.google.com/_/oauthredirect" \

    --name=$(hostname)



7. You use this command to set up and start the Chrome Remote Desktop service on your VM instance, linking it with your Google Account using the authorization code. \
**Note:** The authorization code in the command line is valid for only a few minutes, and you can use it only once.
8. Copy the command to the SSH window that's connected to your instance, and then run the command.
9. When you're prompted, enter a 6-digit PIN. This number will be used for additional authorization when you connect later. \
You might see errors like No net_fetcher or Failed to read. You can ignore these errors.
10. Verify that the service is running using the following command.
11. If the service is running, you see output that includes the state active:

chrome-remote-desktop.service - LSB: Chrome Remote Desktop service

    Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/chrome-remote-desktop@USER.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

    Active: **active (running)** since DATE_TIME; ELAPSED_TIME


## Connect to the VM instance

You can connect to the VM instance using the Chrome Remote Desktop web application.



1. On your local computer, go to the [Chrome Remote Desktop](https://remotedesktop.google.com/) website.
2. Click **Access my computer.**
3. If you're not already signed in to Google, sign in with the same Google Account that you used to set up the Chrome Remote Desktop service. \
You see your new VM instance crdhost in the **Remote Devices** list.
4. Click the name of the remote desktop instance.
5. When you're prompted, enter the PIN that you created earlier, and then click the arrow button to connect. \
You are now connected to the desktop environment on your remote Compute Engine instance.
6. If you are prompted, always allow the Remote Desktop application to read your clipboard and let you copy and paste between local and remote applications.

Google Account does not have a password . When linux system Screen lock happens, there is NO way to get back into the session. 

Go to “Settings” -> “Privacy & Security” -> “Screen Lock” session.

Disable Black Screen Delay and Automatic Screen Lock like the pic shown below:  \
